# surfmap_storage
A storage system for the surfmapper project.

Surfmapper is a project designed to keep track of browsing history and visualize it in a node graph. 
This is a storage system, which currently uses JSON.
It is capable of:
1. collect surfing data from logs, written by Fiddler.
2. collect surfing data which is sent by chrome extension through the SOAP interface.
3. execute queries on the collected data, returning subgraph data through the SOAP interface or writing it into report files.
I have no plans to describe any installation procedures in the near future.
